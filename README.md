There's an experimental patch for windows in this [PR](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-PID-Control-Project/pull/3)

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./pid`. 

Tips for setting up your environment can be found [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/23d376c7-0195-4276-bdf0-e02f1f3c665d)

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!

More information is only accessible by people who are already enrolled in Term 2
of CarND. If you are enrolled, see [the project page](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/f1820894-8322-4bb3-81aa-b26b3c6dcbaf/lessons/e8235395-22dd-4b87-88e0-d108c5e5bbf4/concepts/6a4d8d42-6a04-4aa6-b284-1697c0fd6562)

### PID implementation

In this project, I have implemented 2 PID controllers, one for controlling the speed and one for controlling the turn rate.

The PID controller for turn rate is used to keep the car on track under a constant speed, but using this PID controller alone cannot make the car to turn
at a high speed, so there is a need for the second PID controller to control the speed of the car.

Normally the car will try to achieve a speed of 60m/s, if the error term in turn rate is too high, the speed will be reduced to 
33m/s. The robot set the target speed and the PID controller controlling the speed accelerates / decelerates the car.

### Effect of the P, I, D components had in the implementation

PID graphical representation

![alt text][image5]

The control function is of this form

![alt text][image1]

Where ![alt text][image4], ![alt text][image3] and ![alt text][image2] are all non-negative, denote the coefficient of proportional, integral, derivative terms.

P: proportional to the current value of error. If there is an error, the control output will be proportionately to the error, taking into the account the gain factor Kp

I: account for the past error value and integrates them over time. This term seeks to eliminate the residual error by adding a control effect due to the historic cumulative value of the
error. When the error is first eliminated, the integral term is not zero and hence oscilate a bit before settling down.

D: this term seek to reduce the effect of the error by exerting a control influence generated by the rate of error change. The more rapid the change, the greater the controlling or dampening effect.

Let see the effect of P controller, PD controller, and PID controller on a step change (from 1 to 0).

### To choose the final hyperparameters

In this project, I use twiddle algorithm to find the final set of hyperparameters. The implementation is ```twiddle.cpp```.

The implementation make use of the simulator. It set the PID controller to an initial value, and run the twiddle algorithm, each 
combination of Kp, Ki and Kd are used to control the car for say 20s, and record the error. There are cases where the car run off the road,
in these cases, I restart the program with the best Kp, Ki and Kd I have found in the previous run.

The final hyperparameters I have found is as followed:

|         | ![alt text][image4]   | ![alt text][image3] | ![alt text][image2] |
|:-----:| :-----:| :-----:| :-----:|
| Steering | 0.13715 | 0.0002398 | 2.95 |
| Speed | 0.2 | 0 | 0.02 |
